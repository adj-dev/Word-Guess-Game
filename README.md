Explain the box model, its 4 components, and related css properties.

The box model defines how elements are rendered on screen. It is composed of the CONTENT, the PADDING, the BORDER, and the MARGIN. CSS properties that are responsible for controlling the shape and size of these components are: border, width, height, margin, and padding. 


# Pseudo-code

The game behaves like a hangman game, with whichever theme that it chosen. 

## Basic Layout

- Title of Game
- "press any key to start"
- Total Wins
- number of guesses remaining
- Letters guessed correct (- a r - - - )
- Letters guessed incorrect

## Logic

Game won't start until a key is pressed. Once key is pressed a listener function will trigger the game to start.
