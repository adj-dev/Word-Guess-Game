# Introduction

Game won't start until a key is pressed. Once key is pressed a listener function will trigger the game to start. 

Game is currently lacking some luster... I plan on eventually adding images, sounds and more such novelties! 

## Instructions for play

Clone the repo into a local directory on your machine. Open index.html in the browser of your choice.

## Notes for TA 

Refresh the page (don't use keyboard shortcut) to properly render the app. I didn't test thoroughly enough and caught it the morning after it was due.
